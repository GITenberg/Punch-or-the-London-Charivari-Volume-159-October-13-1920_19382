<h2><b>CHARIVARIA.</b></h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Riazanov</span>, the successor to <span class="sc">Kameneff</span>,
is now residing in Grosvenor
Street. Several readers have written
to ask us how his name is pronounced.
Wrongly, we believe, in nine cases out
of ten.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We have been given to understand
that that versatile pair, the <span class="sc">Two Bobs</span>,
are contemplating a tour of the music-halls
in the mining district, where they
are sure to be given a rousing reception.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The Evening News</i> two
miners recently played a quoit match for
a hundred pounds. In all probability
they are now agitating for the two shillings'
increase to enable
them to have a little side
bet.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"We cannot choose
how we will be born,"
says a medical writer.
No; some are born poor
and others are born into
a miner's family.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Where stands England
to-day?" we are
asked. While travelling
in the Tube we have
often thought that most
of it was standing on
our feet.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"With the outgoing
of September we face
once more the month of
October, with its falling
leaves and autumn gales,"
states a writer in a daily
paper. This, we understand, is according
to precedent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Glamorgan collier, summoned for
income-tax, stated that he earned eleven
pounds a week and wanted every penny
of it. It is said that he is saving up to
buy a strike of his own.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A live frog is reported to have been
found in a coal seam at a Monmouthshire
colliery. It seems to have been
greatly concerned at having missed the
previous strike ballot.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With reference to Mr. <span class="sc">Spender's</span> interview
with Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> we regret
that no mention is made of the exact
date when the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> will
declare the New World open.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Since it has been so well advertised
we understand that the banned poster,
"The Unknown," is shortly to be renamed
"The Very Well Known."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">ex-Kaiser</span> is reported to have
made his will. He has bequeathed his
trial to his youngest grandson.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is proposed to make Poole a first-class
port, at a cost of £3,750,000. We
cannot help thinking that hidden away
in some Government office is a man
who could do it at treble the cost.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A London firm of pastrycooks have
purchased two obsolete tanks from the
Disposal Boards. They are said to
make excellent utensils for flattening
pancakes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A dainty little invention has just been
tried by the Bolshevists, which consists
of a method whereby boiling water from
the ship's boiler can be pumped on to
sailors who do not obey their officers.
It is said to be just the thing to keep
their minds off the idea of mutiny.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I have all the qualifications for a
post in some Government office," writes
an Unemployed Ex-Soldier in a contemporary.
It is to be hoped that this
drawback will be overlooked if his other
disqualifications are satisfactory.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Washable hats for boys is one of the
new inventions at the Leather and Shoe
Trade Exhibition. Small boys are now
going about in fear that the next discovery
will be a washable neck.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Six bandits entered the Central Café,
New York, the other day and took one
thousand pounds from the diners. The
ease with which they did it suggests
that they were mistaken for waiters.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A plumber in Aberdeen is giving lessons
to a women's class in knitting. It
is said that his treatise on How to
Crochet a Burst Bath-Pipe is likely to
become a standard work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In taking away a safe containing six
thousand pounds from a Fenchurch
Street office, burglars broke down a door
with a thick glass panel. The profession
is of the opinion that the blame
for this lies with the firm. They had
locked the door.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Daily Chronicle</i> informs us that
a New York couple who were engaged
in 1868 have just been married. But
surely the wonder is that they were
not married long before.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A woman has told the
medical officer of Burnham
that rats so like the
poison being used that
they come out of their
holes for it while it is
being put down. We
always make our rats
stand up and beg for it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A domestic servant
was recently blown out
of her mistress's house
through the too liberal
use of paraffin whilst
lighting fires. Luckily,
however, it was her day
out, so no complications
ensued.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On being asked his recipe
for keeping young, a
well-known physician refused
to reply. In view
of the increasing number
of precocious authors, the question
again arises, "Should a doctor tell?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Daily Express</i> states that there
is "very little demand for champagne
to-day." We fancy this is due to the
fact that a number of people are saving
up to buy coffee at Messrs. <span class="sc">Lyons'</span>.</p>

<h2><b>YET ONE MORE PLAN FOR IRELAND.</b></h2>

<p>Feeling rather lonely because almost
everybody had entered for the great
Irish Problem Competition in the morning
and evening press except myself, I
sat down and wrote the following solution,
which I posted immediately to the
Editors of <i>The Times</i> and of <i>The Westminster
Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sir</span>"&mdash;I began indignantly, for I
noticed all the best competitors begin
like that. In these Bolshevistic days I
should have preferred of course to have
started off with "Comrade" or "Brother,"
or even, since I was writing from the
heart of the country, have opened with
"Eh bor," as people do in dialect novels,
but, fearing I might be disqualified, I
began, as I say, "Sir," and went on,
much as the other statesmen did:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In all the lengthy annals of this
Government, vacillation between weakness
and tyranny has never proved so
disastrous as it is proving in Ireland to-day,
and the conduct of that unhappy
country's affairs is now plunged in a
chaos so profoundly chaotic that it has
become a gross misuse of language to
call them affairs at all. Out of all this
welter and confusion two salient facts
are seen to emerge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(1) No two Englishmen are agreed
upon a settlement that will at the same
time satisfy the just aspirations of Ireland
and preserve the integrity of the
British Empire.</p>

<p>"(2) No two Irishmen are either.</p>

<p>"At the same time the number of sane
and carefully considered plans for the
government of Ireland was never so
great as it is to-day. When will our
incompetent Cabinet perceive that the
only way of warding off the stain of
perfidy which dogs their footsteps and
threatens to overwhelm them is to make
use of all these plans? I put aside for
the moment the most violent proposals
of the extremists on either side, such as
that of the annexation of England by the
Sinn Fein Empire and that of the deportation
of all Irishmen to the Andaman
Islands and the re-colonisation of the
country with correspondents to the daily
press; but between these two extremes
there surely lie innumerable solutions
which both can and ought to be employed.
I will only name here a few
of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Asquith</span> autonomy.</p>
<p>Dominion Home Rule.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dunraven</span> autonomy.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grey</span> autonomy.</p>
<p>Red autonomy.</p>
<p>Government by Dhail Eireann.</p>
<p>Government by Dhail Ymaill.</p>
<p>Administration by the L. C. C.</p>
<p>Clan warfare.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"And there are infinite shades and
variations of all these.</p>

<p>"Every one of the policies I have
named, and as many more as possible,
should now be adopted at once, one
after the other, I suggest, for quarterly
periods and in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>"But let there be no mistake. They
must be strictly enforced. It must be
impossible for Irishmen to come to
England in the future and say to her,
as they have so often said in the past,
'You made us promises which, when
we leant on them, proved a broken
reed and turned to dust and ashes in
our mouths.'</p>

<p>"One of the bitterest reproaches that
is hurled, and hurled justly, at British
maladministration is that through all
the seeming variations of misgovernment
there has been in fact no change.
Dublin Castle remains where it did.
This must be altered at once. <i>The site of
Dublin Castle must be moved every three
months.</i> There must be infinite change,
and it must be infinitely thorough and
infinitely systematic, so that, side by
side with the continuous grievances of
all dissatisfied parties, will be the certain
assurance that those grievances
will in strict rotation be remedied.</p>

<p>"The objection will, of course, be
raised that these continual changes
of government will involve a certain
amount of disorder; that one system
will scarcely be working before it is
superseded by another; that the rapid
alterations in the <i>personnel</i> of the judicature,
civil service and police will be
inconvenient; that everything, in fact,
will be in a muddle. But by how much
is not well-organised muddle to be preferred
to unsystematic anarchy? And
as each type of government recurs in
due course will it not be found to work
more simply and satisfactorily?</p>

<p>"To those who shrug their shoulders
and say that a series of kaleidoscopic
changes in Irish administration would
never be approved by the good sense
of the British electorate I can only
urge that it is precisely this attitude
of intolerance towards and ignorance
of Irish psychology which has rendered
our behaviour to Ireland for so many
centuries a by-word not only throughout
Europe but the whole civilised world
and the United States of America.</p>

<p>"I am, Sir, yours, etc."</p>

<p>Through some accident or other,
either because I have not followed
exactly the prescribed rules of the competition,
such as writing on one side of
the paper only, or addressing it from
the National Liberal Club, or obtaining
the signature of five witnesses, my solution
has not yet appeared in <i>The Times</i>
or in <i>The Westminster Gazette</i> either.
Feeling it a pity, however, that any
helpful suggestion should be lost at a
time when never in the annals of Irish
misgovernment has vacillation vacillated
so vacillatingly as it does to-day,
I have repeated my strong but simple
proposals here.</p>

<h2><b>ELIZABETH OUTWITTED.</b></h2>

<p>"An' when I dies they give me
fifteen pounds on the nail an' no
waitin'," said Elizabeth triumphantly,
as she explained her latest insurance
scheme.</p>

<p>"On what nail?" I asked distrustfully.
I could not understand why
Elizabeth felt justified in paying sixpence
per week for a benefit fraught
with so little ultimate joy to herself.
But she is the sort of girl that can
never resist the back-door tout. She
is constantly being persuaded to buy
something for which she pays a small
weekly sum. This is entered in a book,
and the only conditions are that she
must continue paying that sum for the
rest of her natural lifetime.</p>

<p>On these lines Elizabeth has "put
in" for many articles in the course of
her chequered career. She has had
fleeting possession of a steel engraving
of <span class="sc">Queen Victoria</span>, a watch that never
would go&mdash;until her payments ceased&mdash;a
sewing-machine (treadle), a set of
vases and a marble timepiece. The
timepiece, she explained, was destined
for "the bottom drawer," which she
had begun to furnish from the moment
a young man first inquired which was
her night out.</p>

<p>As all these things were taken from
her directly her payments fell off, I
thought I had better give her the
benefit of my ripe judgment. "I
shouldn't buy anything on the instalment
plan, if I were you," I advised.
"Some people seem to be made for the
system, but you are not one of them."</p>

<p>"But I 'aven't told you wot I'm
buyin' now," she said excitedly, putting
a plate on the rack as she spoke. I
ought to say she meant to put it on
the rack; that it fell two inches short
wasn't Elizabeth's fault.</p>

<p>"It was cracked afore," she murmured
mechanically as she gathered up
the fragments. "Yes, I pays a shillin'
a week an' I gets a grammerfone."</p>

<p>"A what?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"A grammerfone&mdash;to play, you
know."</p>

<p>"Where will it play?" I asked
feebly.</p>

<p>"'Ere," she said, waving a comprehensive
hand; "an' it won't 'arf liven
the place up. My friend 'as 'ers goin'
all day long."</p>

<p>I stifled a moan of horror, for I am
one of the elect few who loathe gramophones,
even at their best and costliest.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," I cried, tears of anguish
rising to my eyes, "let me implore you
not to get one of those horr&mdash;I mean,
not to be imposed on again."</p>

<p>"I've got it," she announced. "I
meantersay I've paid the first shillin'
an' it's comin' to-morrow. I 'ave it a
month on trial."</p>

<p>The month certainly was a trial&mdash;for
me. Ours is not one of those old-fashioned
residences with thick walls
that muffle sound, and where servants
can be consigned to dwell in the bowels
of the earth. Every noise which arises
in the kitchen, from Elizabeth's badinage
with the butcher's boy to the
raucous grind of the knife-machine,
echoes through the house <i>viâ</i> the study
where I work.</p>

<p>Thus, although Elizabeth kept the
kitchen-door shut, I found myself compelled
for one-half of the day to consider
an insistent demand as to the ultimate
destination of flies in the winter-time.
The rest of the day the gramophone
gave us <i>K-K-K-Katie</i>. (Elizabeth had
only two records to begin with.)</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
<p>I became unnerved. My work suffered.
It began to trickle back to me
accompanied by the regrets of editors;
and to writers the regrets of editors
are the most poignant in the world.</p>

<p>The situation was saved by the most
up-to-date tout of the whole back-door
tribe. He persuaded Elizabeth to go
in for Spiritualism. Do not misunderstand
me. You can be a Spiritualist
and also keep a gramophone, but, if
you are Elizabeth, you cannot keep
the two running at the same time if
you must pay a shilling per week for
each. When she sought my opinion I
strongly advised the séances, which I
said were cheap at the price; indeed
I thought they were when the gramophone
departed.</p>

<p>It was now Elizabeth's turn to become
unnerved. She has a mind that
is peculiarly open to impressions, and
communion with the spirits unbalanced
her. She justified her expenditure of
a shilling weekly by placing the utmost
faith in them.</p>

<p>"I 'ad a message from them there
spirits larst night," she informed me
one day, "an' they tell me I must
change my 'abitation."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked,
startled.</p>

<p>"I put a message through, arskin'
them when I should get a settled young
man, an' they told me that the fates
are agen me in my present dwellin',
so if you'll please take my notice
from&mdash;"</p>

<p>I will not go through the sickening
formula. Every housewife must have
heard it several times at least in the
past year or so. I accepted Elizabeth's
resignation and began to concentrate
on newspaper announcements. But I
took an utter dislike to the spirits and
listened with cold aloofness when Elizabeth
began, "I was talkin' to the spirit
of my young man larst night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had the spirit of
any young man," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes, I 'ave. I mean Ned Akroyd,
'oo was drownded."</p>

<p>Now I have never believed in the
alleged drowning of the said Ned. The
news&mdash;conveyed to Elizabeth by his
mate&mdash;that he had fallen from a ferry-boat
near Eel Pie Island seemed unconvincing,
especially as it happened shortly
after Elizabeth had lent him fifteen-and-six.</p>

<p>"I 'ad quite a long talk with 'im,"
she went on. "Next time I'm goin' to
arst 'im about the fifteen-and-six 'e
borrowed, an' see if I can't get it back
some'ow."</p>

<p>How the spirit would have considered
this proposition is still uncertain, for
Elizabeth never returned to the séances.
She came to me one day in a state of
violent agitation. "I see Ned Akroyd
when I was out larst night," she began,
"an' would you believe it, 'e's no more
dead than I am, the wretch!"</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you glad?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Glad, an' 'im with another girl an'
pretendin' all the time not to see me!
Men are 'ounds, that's what they are.
An' I'll go to no more seeonces. They're
a swindle."</p>

<p>"They were wrong about telling you
to change your habitation too, weren't
they?" I suggested insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"Course they were." Suddenly her
face brightened. "I'll be able to 'ave
the grammerfone back now," she said.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At the moment I am writing to the
sounds of <i>K-K-K-Katie</i>, which, I fear, is
giving me rather a syncopated style.
But if the Editor is k-k-k-kind he will
not banish me from <i>P-P-P-Punch</i> for
this reason, as anyone can see my intentions
are g-g-g-good.</p>

<p>Stay! <i>K-K-K-Katie</i> has ceased and
I can think lucidly. An inspiration has
come to me. Has not Elizabeth in her
time wrought havoc among my crockery?
The hour is ripe for me to
retaliate.</p>

<p>To morrow at dawn I shall examine
the gramophone records and&mdash;<i>they will
come in two in my hands</i>.</p>

<p>It will be the first time I have broken
any record.</p>

<h2><b>THE CONSPIRATORS.</b></h2>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p><span class="sc">My dear Charles</span>,&mdash;Essential to that
millennium which our restless revolutionaries
are after is your head on a
charger and my head on a charger; provided
both heads are present it may
be the same charger for all they care.
When you think of the importance
which we of the detested middle classes
attach to our heads and the regrettable
violence we might exhibit towards whoever
called at our houses to collect them,
then it seems to me you must confess
to a sneaking admiration for the bravery
of the turbulent minority in attacking
so big a problem.</p>

<p>But when you get the inside details
of their schemes you find that discretion
is not only the better part but
the whole of their valour. For arms
you find incendiary speeches; for ammunition,
viperish propaganda, and
for epoch-making action you have
nothing. In that "nothing" lies their
main ingenuity and strong hope. If
they can prevail on the masses to do
nothing, at the right moment, and to
go on doing nothing till there is nothing
left, then, say they, they will have
civilisation under; and if our heads
don't fall off of their own accord
then a thousand willing hands will be
stretched forward to pull them off.</p>

<p>You ask me how I know all this.
Close the doors so that we cannot be
overheard, and I will tell you. I buy
their continental newspaper&mdash;"organ"
they prefer to call it, being rather
proud of the noise&mdash;and there I read
all that I want to know. It costs a
halfpenny a day, runs to six pages, is
well printed and brightly composed and
contains no advertisements. There is
generally a picture in thick black lines
in the centre of the first page. Blood
being the easy thing for the printer to
"feature," the picture generally deals
with the cutting off of heads. If it
refers to the past, you and I are cutting
off the worker's head, severing from a
fine muscular body a noble head with
a halo to it. If it refers to the future,
the worker is having our heads off,
severing from a fat and uncontrolled
corpus a most unpleasant excrescence
in a very shiny top-hat.</p>

<p>To run a daily newspaper of that
"make-up," without advertisements
and for subscribers of whom the larger
number, like myself, omit to pay their
half-penny, is not easy business. In
fact it is not business at all. The
question being raised as to where the
money came from, the producers tried
to allay our suspicion by making a great
show of an appeal for help. The published
results, which I give you in
their English equivalent, were much
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The grand total of sixteen pounds,
nine shillings and eight-pence three-farthings
shows a magnificent spirit,
but wouldn't keep much more than a
couple of square inches of the front
page alive for more than one day.
Reverting, then, to the more pressing
question of the removal of our heads,
who is paying for the operation?</p>

<p>He is a heavy-built octopus sort of
man of about forty-seven; a red cheery
complexion, rather more fat than muscle,
long grey hair tending to curl at
the extremes, and followed about by a
lady who acts as his secretary, calls
him "Master" and adores the ground
he walks on. They are married, but
not, I should hasten to add, to each
other; none of your dull orthodox practices
for them. About his profile there
is an undeniable something which
makes his head a suggestive model for
sculpture. It is framed in a large,
white, soft silk collar, which falls gracefully
over the lapels of the coat and is,
I am told, of a mode much worn among
the <i>élite</i> of the anarchist and atheist
world.</p>

<p>I've a friend here in the law-and-order
business who thought that, having reported
all the movements of this Master
of the Black Arts, he might find it
worth while to make his acquaintance
in the flesh. Indirect enquiry elicited
that the desire to get into touch was
reciprocated, the attentions of the police
being insufficient to satisfy his sense
of importance. So the meeting was
arranged, and I was allowed to come
along too.</p>

<p>We were received in great state in a
special suite of the local hotel de luxe.
The Lady Secretary was there, overflowing
with "Masters" and "Sirs,"
and obsessed by the fear that her idol
might not do himself justice in our
presence. A very touching instance of
human devotion: the fifth instance in
his case, I believe.</p>

<p>This is the gentleman who finances
the propaganda of destruction; we
asked him if that was not so, and he
answered, "Why, of course." Had we
any fault to find with his protégé, the
admirable halfpenny daily? We had
noticed that its news was punctual and
exact. Then of what did we complain?</p>

<p>"Of a certain exaggeration in the
leading articles," said I, rubbing the
back of my neck and wondering how
long it would be there to rub and I to
rub it.</p>

<p>"But what newspaper leaders are
not exaggerated?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Your editors should not be paid to
twist everything into an irritant," I
protested.</p>

<p>"Of which of your great English
dailies is the editor not paid to twist,
as you put it?" he asked.</p>

<p>I knew that I had right on my side
and he had not. But still somehow I
seemed to be in the wrong all the way.</p>

<p>So my friend took the matter in hand.
He didn't argue. He just drew his chair
up to the Master's and asked him to
tell us all about himself, how he came
by his great ideals, what was the future
of the world as he foresaw it and how
he meant to arrange the universe when
at length he took over?</p>

<p>The Master, gently smiling his appreciation
of this recognition of his
Ego, gave voice.</p>

<p>To the lady it was all, of course,
above criticism: sublime, adorable. To
me the frankness of it and the impudence
of it was, I confess, amusing.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The world is out of joint; how good 'twill be</p>
<p>When Heaven is sacked and leaves the job to me!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>An agreeable, if wrong-headed, crank,
was my summary.</p>

<p>And this or something like it was my
friend's:&mdash;"b. U.S.A. of Eng. parents,
9.5.78; tinned meat business, Chicago;
6 months' h.l. for frauds in connection
with packing; went to Mexico, but left
to avoid prosecution for similar frauds
on larger scale; prison in Belgium,
France and England in connection
with illegal dealings in rifles (? for
Germany); apparently liable to more
prison in U.S.A. for crime unknown, if
returns there; won't say where he gets
his money from, but doesn't seriously
pretend it is his own."</p>

<p>And when I came to go back over
the Master's two hours' chat about
himself, those are about the facts it all
boiled down to.</p>

<h2><b>THE KORBAN BATH</b>.</h2>

<p>[<i>Korban</i>&mdash;"It is a gift"&mdash;Hebrew (or some
such language).]</p>

<p>With some reluctance I return to
the subject of baths. I went into the
matter of bathrooms pretty carefully a
few months ago, but since I have been
in this hotel I see that there are one
or two aspects of hotel bathing which
still require attention.</p>

<p>To begin with, there is the question
of the Korban or free bath. It is, of
course, a scandal that a bath should be
an extra, and an eighteen-penny one at
that. After all, what is the bathroom
for? We are not charged extra for
smoking in the smoking-room or
drawing in the drawing-room; why
should we be bled for bathing in
the bathroom? At the same time
this practice does provide the
visitor with the wholesome sport
of Korban bathing. The object of
the game is, of course, to have as
many baths as possible which are
not put down in your bill; and
many are the stratagems which
are employed.</p>

<p>The true sportsman attempts
the feat just before dinner, because
at that time there are sentries
posted in every corridor. Ostensibly
they are maids waiting to
assist any lady who has a crisis
while dressing, but no real pretence
is made that they are there
for any other purpose than to
charge you for as many baths as
possible. On my corridor there
is a post of no fewer than three
sentries, and it is extremely difficult
to evade them. The only
thing to do is to get to know three
nice ladies on the same floor and
arrange for them to have a dressing
crisis simultaneously and go
on having it for about a quarter-of-an-hour.</p>

<p>This needs a good deal of organisation.
However smoothly the operation
begins, one of the dressing crises
nearly always collapses too soon, and
the sentry catches you on your return
journey.</p>

<p>For the lady visitor the problem is
comparatively simple. I should mention
that it is a perfectly legitimate
man&oelig;uvre to get your bath put down
to somebody else if you can do it; and
the crack lady-player usually wraps
herself in an unobtrusive bath-wrap,
shrouds her head, modestly conceals
her face, slips into a friend's room to
borrow some Crème-Limon and, after
an interval, rushes noisily out of the
friend's room to her bath, which, with
any luck, is charged to her friend's
account.</p>

<p>The beginner at the game contents
himself with less complicated ruses.
Sometimes he has his bath late at
night, when the sentries have been
taken off; but, as the lights go out <i>en masse</i> at
eleven, even this operation has
to be carefully timed. There is nothing
much gloomier than a bath by candle-light,
except perhaps a bath in the dark.
Hundreds, however, of both sorts are
endured in this hotel.</p>

<p>The more brazen or the more timid
simply walk into the bathroom fully
dressed during the day, carrying a number
of dirty golf-balls in their hands,
and towels in their pockets and sponges
up their sleeves, and issue later fully
dressed with clean white golf-balls in
their hands. It is generally thought,
however, that this device is <i>just</i> a
little&mdash;I mean it's not exactly&mdash;<i>you</i>
know what I mean.</p>

<p>The Korban Bath Rules will probably
remain unwritten for many a day, but I
earnestly hope that before next summer
the traditions and etiquette of bath-warfare
as between individual hotel-visitors
will be codified and issued in
an intelligible form. At the moment
the most extraordinary confusion prevails,
and no one can tell whether any
particular stratagem will be hailed with
applause as a bold and legitimate
operation of war or universally condemned
as a barefaced piece of bath-hoggery.
Recently, for example, an
extremely courteous, not to say gallant,
old gentleman was severely lectured
by a lady for digging himself in on the
mat and maintaining his position there
till she emerged. She stated with, I
think, considerable force that she had
passed the age when a lady likes to be
seen coming out of a bathroom with
disordered locks; she also said that he
was ruining her chance of a Korban
bath by drawing attention to the fact
that there was somebody inside.</p>

<p>He replied with equal force that,
whenever he considerately withdrew
from the mat in order to let a lady
escape unseen, some less scrupulous
combatant (usually one of his
own daughters) immediately
rushed the position, and he was
not going to be had in that way
again, though as a matter of fact,
while they were arguing the matter
out, somebody actually did
this, so he was.</p>

<p>Now what is the way out of
this dilemma? The only solution
I see is the Sponge System, by
which every competitor puts
down a sponge, as one puts down
a ball at the first tee. In this
way definite claims can be staked
out in rotation without congestion
of the avenues of approach.
I hope this system will be generally
adopted next summer and, if
it is used in conjunction with my
Progress Indicator (which shows
by a moving needle what stage
the person bathing has reached),
it ought to work very smoothly.
But there must be no hanky-panky,
no sharp practice with
caddies; every sponge must be
put down by one of the players
in person. And there must be
none of that regrettable collusion
between husband and wife which
has brought such discredit on the
present system.</p>

<p>There was a very bad case of this
the other day. A certain wife used to
entrench herself in the bathroom early
and remain in it till her husband&mdash;a
heavy and persistent sleeper&mdash;arrived.
When you rattled angrily at the door-knob
she said very sharply, "Who is
that?"&mdash;in itself a sufficiently disturbing
thing. Even in the present days of
shamelessness and crime there are few
men who care to confess openly that
they have angrily rattled at the bathroom
door. If you said sheepishly, "It
is Smith" or "Thompson" or "Lord
Bumble," a heavy silence fell, broken
only by those gentle watery sounds
which it is so maddening to hear from
without. When her husband arrived
and answered the challenge with "It
is I, Arthur," sounds of feverish activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span>
were heard within, and a new bath
was immediately turned on.</p>

<p>Casting all scruples to the winds,
seven desperate men rehearsed the password,
"It is I, Arthur;" seven desperate
men presented themselves in a single
morning and murmured lovingly, "It
is I, Arthur." None of them had a
bath. Seven times the good lady opened
the door and beheld Smith or Thompson
or Lord Rumble or nobody. And seven
times she bolted back into the burrow
again. She remained undefeated. Her
husband got his bath.</p>

<p>I wonder what devilry she would be
up to under the Sponge System.</p>

<h2><b>PRISCILLA FAILS TO QUALIFY</b>.</h2>

<p>"So it runned out of its little grassy
place and went all round the garden,"
said Priscilla, emerging suddenly in
pink from under the table.</p>

<p>"What are you playing at now,
Priscilla?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm a little pussy-cat."</p>

<p>"And what is this?" I asked, pointing
to the waste-paper basket which
she had planted beside my chair.</p>

<p>"It's the pussy-cat's basket of milk.
It's to drink when she's firsty," she
explained.</p>

<p>I sighed. It did not appear to me
that the child's education was proceeding
upon proper lines. I had been
reading portions of the diary of Miss
<span class="sc">Opal Whiteley</span>, written when she was
seven years old, a work which has just
lifted for America the Child-authoress
Cup. I had hoped to find in Priscilla
some faint signs that the laurels lost
by Miss <span class="sc">Daisy Ashford</span> might be
wrested back. The latest feature in
nursery autobiography, so far as I
could gather, was to have a profound
objective sympathy with vegetables
and a faculty for naming domestic animals
after the principal figures in classical
mythology. If you have these
gifts you get published by <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, with a preface by Viscount
<span class="sc">Grey</span>. But I doubted whether Priscilla
had them. I thought I would try.</p>

<p>"Priscilla," I said, "be a little girl
again and tell me what flower you like
best."</p>

<p>"Woses."</p>

<p>"What do the roses say to each
other when you aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they don't <i>say</i> anyfing," she
said with great contempt.</p>

<p>This was bad.</p>

<p>"Priscilla," I continued, "what do
you call the dog next-door?"</p>

<p>"Bill," she said; "but it's runned
away."</p>

<p>"There you are!" I exclaimed, turning
to the child's mamma. "Bill, indeed!
If she were being properly educated
she would be calling it Jupiter
Agamemnon Wilcox by now. Does she
ever speak to you at all of the star-gleams
amongst the cabbage-leaves?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there are any star-gleams
amongst the cabbages in this
garden," she replied. "Only slugs."</p>

<p>"I don't care," I said; "the fact
remains that Priscilla ought to be constantly
wondering what the cabbages
do say to each other when they have
lonesome feels at night."</p>

<p>"Priscilla," I began again, "in about
three years you will be seven years old
and quite a big girl. What will you
play at then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I san't play at all," she said. "I sall go visiting and sopping."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I sall have a knife."</p>

<p>"A pocket-knife?"</p>

<p>"No, not a pocket-knife, a knife to cut meat wiv, of course."</p>

<p>I had forgotten this goal of maidenly
desires.</p>

<p>"And won't you go long walks in the
big woods with me and tell me the
names of all the flowers and what they
are thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied rather doubtfully.
"Are there beasts in the woods?"</p>

<p>"Only rabbits, I think."</p>

<p>"We must be very careful, then, 'cos
they're <i>very</i> wild creatures, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not <i>very</i> wild."</p>

<p>"Will you buy a gun at the gun-sop
and soot them and we take them home
and eat them?"</p>

<p>Bless the child, I thought, there
seems to be no getting her away from
this eating business.</p>

<p>"Priscilla," I began again, "in the
woods there is a great big lake, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>
trees and rushes all round it, and there
are water-lilies floating about and
forget-me-nots at the edge."</p>

<p>Now, I thought, we shall perhaps
have something about the lullaby songs
of the trees and the willow that does
sing by the creek.</p>

<p>"Are there fiss in the lake?" inquired
Priscilla.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "beautiful shining fish."</p>

<p>"And sall we catch the fiss and put
them on the fire?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we might," I admitted.</p>

<p>"And will they sizzle?"</p>

<p>"Araminta," I said, "the child is
hopeless. She has no soul. She will
never be a great authoress. The Cup
must remain in Oregon, and Priscilla
will never tell the world how the wind
did go walking in the field, talking to
the earth voices, with a preface by Sir
<span class="sc">Auckland Geddes</span> or Lord <span class="sc">Reading</span>.
She thinks about nothing but her food."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better try again
after she's said her prayers," suggested
Araminta. "She may be feeling a little
more soulful then."</p>

<p>I attended the ceremony, which was
performed with the utmost decorum and
gravity. When it was ended Priscilla
looked up.</p>

<p>"I said them very somnly and in
rarver a low voice, didn't I?" she
announced, and then went off into
gurgles of laughter.</p>

<p>I determined to make one last despairing
effort.</p>

<p>"Priscilla," I asked, "which of your
books do you like the best?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Gobbly Goblin</i>," she said.</p>

<p>"Araminta," I cried, "I give it up.
She has no bent for literature. There
can never have been any great authoress,
young or old, who started with such a
materialistic mind."</p>

<p>"You forget Mrs. Beeton," she replied.</p>

<p>I was so glad to hear yesterday that

had been duly received. I was beginning
to get quite anxious about it.
In reply to your inquiry I have the
honour to state (again) that I was

the answer is in the affirmative.
By the way I think we went into that
little matter too last January. But,
of course, you can't think of everything.
Excuse me mentioning it. Do you
think you could get my pension through
by the 30th inst? It is my birthday,

<h2><b>FOR OURSELVES ALONE.</b></h2>

<p>Our hostess had taken us over to "Sheltered End," the
pleasant country home of Mrs. Willoughby Brock, to play
tennis. As however there was only one court and quite a
number of young and middle-aged people were standing near
it with racquets in their hands and an expression on their
faces in which frustration and anticipation fought for supremacy,
it followed that other beguilements had to be found.
My own fate was to fall into the hands of Mrs. Brock, whose
greatest delight on earth seems to be to have a stranger to
whom she can display the beauties of her abode and enlarge
upon the unusual qualities of her personality. She showed
and told me all. We explored the estate from the dog-kennel
to the loggia for sleeping out "under the stars;" from the
pergola to the library; from the sundial to the telephone,
"the only one for miles;" and as we walked between the
purple and mauve Michaelmas daisies in her long herbaceous
borders, with Red
Admiral butterflies
among the myriad
little clean blossoms,
she said how odd it
was that some people
have the gift of
attracting friends
and others not; and
what a strange thing
it is that where one
person has to toil to
make a circle others
are automatically
surrounded by nice
creatures; and asked
me if I had any views
as to the reason, but
did not pause for the
reply.</p>

<p>It was a warm
mellow day&mdash;almost
the first of summer,
according to one's
senses, although
nearly the last, according
to the calendar&mdash;and
Mrs. Brock
was so happy to be
in a monologue that I could enjoy the garden almost without
interruption. For a two and a half years' existence it certainly
was a triumph. Here and there a reddening apple
shone. The hollyhocks must have been ten feet high.</p>

<p>"Ah! here comes the dear Vicar," said Mrs. Brock suddenly,
and, rising up from a rose which I was inhaling (and I wish
that people would grow roses, as they used to do years ago,
nose-high), I saw a black figure approaching.</p>

<p>"He is such a charming man," Mrs. Brock continued,
"and devoted to me."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said the Vicar. "How exquisite those
delphiniums are!" he added after introductions were complete;
"such a delicate blue! I should not have intruded
had I known you had a party"&mdash;he waved his hand towards
the single tennis-court, around which the wistful
racquet-bearers were now (as it seemed) some thousands
strong, "but it is always a pleasure"&mdash;he turned to me&mdash;"to
be able to walk in this paradise on a fine day and
appreciate its colour and its fragrance. I find Mrs. Brock
so valuable a parochial counsellor too."</p>

<p>"I think," I said, not in the least unwilling to be tactful,
"I will see what the rest of our party are doing."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Vicar; "please don't let me drive you
away. As a matter of fact, since there are so many here I
won't stay myself. But I wonder," he addressed Mrs.
Brock, "as I am here, if I might use your telephone for a
moment?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said she.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," he replied; "yes, I know where
it is," and with a genial and courtly salutation he moved
off in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>"Such a true neighbour!" said Mrs. Brock. "Ah! and
here is another," she went on. And along the same path,
where the Michaelmas daisies were thickest, I saw a massive
woman in white, like a ship in full sail, bearing down upon
us, defending her head from the gentle September sun with
a red parasol. "This," Mrs. Brock hurriedly informed me,
"is Lady Cranstone, who lives in the house with the green
shutters at the end of the village. Such a dear person!
She's always in and out. The widow of the famous scientist,
you know."</p>

<p>I didn't know; but
what does it matter?</p>

<p>By this time the
dear person was
within hailing distance,
but she flew
no signals of cordiality;
her demeanour
rather was austere
and arrogant. Mrs.
Brock hurried towards
her to assist
her to her moorings,
and I was duly presented.</p>

<p>"I didn't intend
to come in again
to-day," said Lady
Cranstone, whose
features still successfully
failed to give to
the stranger any indication
of the benignity
that, it was
suggested, irradiated
her being.</p>

<p>"But you are always
so welcome,"
said Mrs. Brock. "Lady Cranstone," she continued to me,
"is kindness itself. She makes all the difference between
loneliness and&mdash;and content."</p>

<p>Lady Cranstone picked a rose and pinned it in her monumental
bosom. "I don't know that I had anything in
particular to say," she remarked. "I chanced to be passing
and I merely looked in; but since I am here perhaps you
would allow me to use your telephone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brock beamed her delighted acquiescence and the
frigate sailed on. "You've no idea," said Mrs. Brock, "what
a friendly crowd there is in these parts. I don't know how
it is, but this little place of mine, modest though it is, and
unassuming and unclever as I am, is positively the very
centre of the district. It's like a club-house. How strange
life is! What curious byways there are in human sympathy!"</p>

<p>This being the kind of remark that is best replied to
with an inarticulate murmur, I provided an inarticulate
murmur; and I was about to make a further and more
determined effort to get away when a maid-servant approached
with a card.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brock took it and read the name with a little cry of
satisfaction. "Lord Risborough," she said to me. "At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span>
last! How nice of him to call. They live at Risborough
Park, you know. I always said they would never condescend
to dignify 'Sheltered End' with their presence;
but I somehow knew they would." She purred a little.
And then, "Where is his lordship?" she asked; but the
girl's reply was rendered unnecessary by the nobleman
himself, who advanced briskly upon Mrs. Brock, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"I trust," he said, "that you will pardon the informality
of this visit. Lady Risborough is so sorry not to have been
able to call yet, but&mdash;but&mdash;Yes, I was wondering if you'd
be so very kind as to do me a little favour? The fact is,
our telephone is out of order&mdash;most annoying&mdash;and I
wondered if you would let me use yours. I hear that you
have one."</p>

<p>"I will take you to it," said Mrs. Brock.</p>

<p>"Most kind, most kind!" his lordship was muttering.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in making my escape now.</p>

<h3>THE PASSING OF ALFRED.</h3>

<p>Alfred is dead and with him has gone
John's last efforts at making and training
pets. It has simply been one disappointment
after another. There was
Charles the monkey. Charles could
write his own name with a pen and
digest the creamiest shaving-stick without
making a lather. There was Joey,
the billy-goat, such an entertaining
fellow, who could pick up and set down
anything with his horns from a basket
to a dustman. And then there was
Livo&mdash;immortal Livo. There never
was such a down-at-heel and unscrupulous
young ruffian of a mongrel terrier as
Livo, nor one that more completely convinced
people that he was a gentleman
of blood and a pure-souled spiritualist.</p>

<p>Of course there were heaps of other
pets as well, but just as they seemed
about to reach that stage of human intelligence
so earnestly desired by their
young master they all suddenly died,
even as Alfred, the last of a long list,
gave up the ghost yesterday.</p>

<p>Alfred was a trout. Not your ordinary
fly-jumping kind of trout, because there
is never anything ordinary about John's
pets. Alfred, for instance, had not lived
in water for three months. He simply
had no use for the stuff, and, as for
jumping at a fly, his nerves were far
too good for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>His attachment to John was complete.
He would take food from no
one else and the presence of his eight-year-old
master in the long grass was
sufficient to bring him erect on his tail,
where he would wag his fins and make
strange noises in cordial welcome. In
many respects he was the most superior
pet John has ever had. He could affect
boredom and his exhibition of the glad
eye was considered by John's eldest
sister to be positively deadly. It is, in
fact, true to say that his keen desire to
adopt as many human habits as possible
often led us to mistake him for
one of ourselves.</p>

<p>John, however, was not quite satisfied
with his pupil until one bright
morning last week when Alfred displayed
the first signs of having acquired
the Directional Wriggle. Strange as
it may sound, this very human trout
actually wriggled after John for a distance
of five yards. Three days later
he pursued his master to the village
post-office and beat him by a short gill.</p>

<p>Yesterday, however, Alfred excelled
himself. John had left early for the
stream, and being in a hurry took
advantage of the thin plank crossing.
Now the plank is very slippery and had
been placed over the spot where the
stream is deepest. John crossed it
carefully enough, but looking back for
a second he suddenly noticed that Alfred
was following him. Before he could
raise his voice in protest the trout had
mounted the plank and was wriggling
across it. Then, horror of horrors! in
the middle of the plank the wretched
fish suddenly lurched, lost its footing,
plunged into the water and was
drowned.</p>

<h3>ROBBERY IN COURT.</h3>

<p>There would seem to be some need
for watchfulness in our Courts of Justice
lest the customs and privileges which
to so great an extent have made them
what they are should be allowed to
lapse.</p>

<p>A great sensation was caused throughout
the legal profession the other day
when it was reported in the Press that
a witness, in giving evidence, made the
following remark:&mdash;"It goes in one ear
and out of the other. Perhaps that
is because there is nothing to stop it."
The report stated that laughter followed,
and, if that was indeed the case,
then we have no hesitation whatever
in characterising it as a most unseemly
outburst.</p>

<p>If witnesses are to be permitted with
impunity to snatch out of the Judge's
mouth the jokes which naturally arise
out of their evidence, our whole judicial
system will be imperilled. In offering
an explanation as to why "it goes in
one ear and out of the other," the
witness committed a grave breach of
etiquette. That explanation, if made
at all, should have been made by the
Judge in the first place. Or if, after
due opportunity had been given, his
Lordship showed no desire to avail
himself of the opening, then the privilege
should have fallen to the examining
counsel. If he in turn waived it, it
should have been open to counsel on
the other side to snap up the chance.</p>

<p>We fail to understand how such a
remark, coming from a witness, could
have been allowed to pass without
rebuke from the Judge or protest from
the counsel, or some attempt at least
to maintain order on the part of the
usher.</p>

<h2><b>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE</b>.</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

<p>I am as a rule very strongly against the form of pedantry
that hastens to cry "imitation" whenever a new writer
finds himself impelled to a theme of the same character as
that already associated with an old-established practitioner.
But in the case of <i>The Lost Horizon</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) I find
myself overwhelmed. Consciously or unconsciously Mr. G.
<span class="sc">Colby Borley</span> has produced a story that in matter and
treatment is so palpably a reflection of <span class="sc">Joseph Conrad</span>
that the likeness simply refuses to be ignored. It is in its
way a good story enough&mdash;an affair of adventure in South
America and on the high seas, with a generous sufficiency of
oaths and blood-letting; a tale moreover that gives evidence
(in spite of that distressing echo) of being written by one
who takes his craft with a becoming dignity of purpose.
One peculiarity of the Master has not only been borrowed
by Mr. <span class="sc">Borley</span>, but exaggerated to his own undoing: I
mean the trick of introducing a character or group of characters
so clogged and obscured by the adhesions of the
uncommunicated past that not till this has been gradually
flaked from them do they emerge as figures in whom it is
possible to take an intelligent interest. In the present
instance this process is delayed for more than half the book.
As for the intrigue, that concerns a group of cut-throat
Europeans, who, having been ruinously involved in a South
American revolution, are now further plunged into the plots
of a scoundrelly African magnate and his conspiratorial
gang. For myself, I parted from them all with a feeling of
regret that they had not explained themselves earlier as the
entertaining villains that they turned out to be.</p>

<p><i>Manhood End</i> (<span class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</span>) is the title, not
very cheery, that Mrs. <span class="sc">Henry Dudeney</span> has given to her
latest novel, a simple and quite human story of country
vicarage life, told sympathetically, but in too many words
for so slight a theme. The publishers are at the wholly
superfluous pains of urging you as a preliminary to read the
"turn-over of cover." Don't! All you will find there is a
synopsis of the plot, just sufficient to destroy the slender
thread of your interest in its development. And I must
record a protest against the entirely unneeded Prologue, in
which total strangers sit round at a churchyard picnic on
the graves of the real protagonists, and speculate as to their
history. The tale itself is placed in Sussex (why this
invidious partiality of our novelists?), the actors being for
the most part clerical. The main interest is centred in
the matrimonial trials of the <i>Rev. Frederick Rainbird</i>,
whose bride, having married him in haste, repented at
leisure, eloped with the promising brother of a neighbouring
parson, repented more, returned to domesticity, ran away
again, and so on, <i>da capo</i>. Perhaps really these simple but
not short annals have a flavour that I have failed to convey.
Mrs. <span class="sc">Dudeney</span> writes easily, but should avoid the snares
of originality. To say of her heroine's morning appearance
at the breakfast table, that she "stood in the tangle of a
delicious coffee smell," may convey an impression, but at a
ruinous expense of style.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Michael Winter</i>, hero of <i>The Black Knight</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>),
by Mrs. <span class="sc">Alfred Sidgwick</span> and <span class="sc">Crosbie Garstin</span>, had led a
nice easy life till his father's nefarious schemes crashed,
bringing down in a common ruin half the small investors
in the country. Left penniless, he changes his disgraced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span>
name and goes out to Canada to make good. There, on the
prairies, he puts in some hard honest work. But, in his
haste to be rich, the <i>Black Knight</i>, as they do in chess,
after moving straight, moved obliquely. In order to make
a coup out of a Wall Street cinch he helped himself to the
money of the bank of which he was cashier. Other people
who shall be nameless have done this sort of thing
before, and, after returning the "borrowed" cash, have
enjoyed a stainless prosperity. But <i>Michael</i>, through a
motor-car accident, just failed to put it back in time, and
had to do two years. But he had made a fortune, and on
emerging from prison returned to Europe to enjoy it.
There he rescues an innocent English girl from a shady
Parisian environment and marries her. By chance she
learns the secret of the source of his wealth and leaves him.
In order to appease her
scruples and recover her he
signs away his goods for the
benefit of his father's creditors.
What might have
been a too sugary conclusion
is saved by a pleasant touch
of corrective irony in the very
last line, where his wife expresses
a very human satisfaction
on finding that her
best necklace was not included
in the noble sacrifice.
I hope I shall not be suspected
of flattering Mr.
Punch's "<span class="sc">Patlander</span>" if I
admire the excellence of the
Canadian section, obviously
contributed by Mr. <span class="sc">Crosbie
Garstin</span>, who has knocked
about most of the world
marked red on the maps.
Here his humour and vitality
are at their keenest. The
rest of a well-told tale I
attribute to Mrs. <span class="sc">Alfred
Sidgwick</span>, with the exception
of a pugilistic episode, for
which I imagine that the
male fist was called in to
supplement her proper inexperience.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">My dear, I <i>felt</i> I ought never to have taken the holiday. Scarcely had I set foot in my apartments when I was handed
a telegram from Sarah:&mdash;'Parrot laid an egg. Wire instructions.'"</span></p>
</div>
<hr />

<p>I do believe that I have
caught a detective napping; a
real private detective, one of the great infallibles of fiction.
Mr. <span class="sc">J. S. Fletcher's</span> <i>Exterior to the Evidence</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
and Stoughton</span>) is one of those thrills in which any of the
characters might have committed the murder and there is
every reason, at times, to suspect that they have all had a hand
in it. Over the moorland there ran a path, and at a spot
known as Black Scar it came perilously near the edge of a
forty-foot drop, with rocks at the bottom. Over this precipice
went <i>Sir Cheville Stanbury</i> at midnight, a very odd circumstance
considering his life-long familiarity with the path.
<i>Weathershaw</i>, the great detective called in to investigate the
matter on behalf of one of the suspects, took a line of his
own and eventually hit upon someone you and I would
never have thought of. We have this excuse, that we had
no idea of his existence until he was hit upon; but no more
had <i>Weathershaw</i>. Now I am not going to give away the
secret of this enticing affair, but I must dispute the detective's
identification, on the last page but one, of the man
responsible for <i>Sir Cheville's</i> death. If you compare the
statement of fact on page 301, seven lines from the bottom,
which corroborates that on page 279, also seven lines from
the bottom, with <i>Weathershaw's</i> dramatic accusation, you
will understand what I mean and you will be left in considerable
doubt (as I was) of what the author means. Does
he suggest that <i>Sir Cheville</i> was never murdered at all?
After so much excitement that would be a sad pity.</p>

<hr />

<p>The publishers of <i>The Amorous Cheat</i> (<span class="sc">Chatto and
Windus</span>) generously label it "an enthralling story of
domestic and stage life." To which my comment must be,
that the domesticity supplied by the hero's family and
their quite uninteresting hesitations between town and
suburban residence are entirely nebulous and illusive, that
the stage as background has no significance one way or
other, but that the impropriety
upon which (I must
say frankly) the appeal of
the book seems to depend is
given without stint, in a
measure that certainly may,
for some readers, justify the
publishers' epithet. You will
understand therefore that I
experience a little natural
hesitation about suggesting
the intrigue. It is certainly
of the simplest&mdash;a mere question
as to whether <i>Edward</i>
and <i>Vivian</i>, casual acquaintances
of a restaurant, shall
or shall not spend a sequence
of week-ends together. The
lady is described as on the
stage, but she might as well
belong to a guild of art-needlework.
<i>Edward</i> is the
only question of importance,
and the week-ends; if you
ponder the significance of the
title you can probably guess
the rest. To be honest I
ought to add that Mr. <span class="sc">Basil
Creighton</span> wields an easy-flowing
pen, and that at
least one chapter certainly
is wickedly entertaining, in
the style of what we used to
call "Continental" humour.
To sum up, not a novel for
family reading or for the fastidious. The others may
even be enthralled.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Diary of a Sportsman Naturalist in India</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>)
contains an excellent collection of sporting anecdotes, and
dip where you may you will find none of them trivial or
tiresome. Mr. <span class="sc">E. P. Stebbing</span> states that his purpose in
selecting material from his note-books was "to emphasize
the necessity which exists of affording protection to the
game and other animals of India," and, shy as some of us
are of purposeful books, there is no reason to be scared by
this one. In the first place Mr. <span class="sc">Stebbing</span>'s purpose is one
which will generally be commended, and in the second he
achieves it in an absolutely unobtrusive manner. To sportsmen,
and especially to those who have enjoyed the good
fortune of shooting in India, this volume will be extremely
welcome. The only cumbrous thing about it is its title.
Add that Mr. <span class="sc">Stebbing</span> is as profuse in his illustrations as
he is happy in his choice of subjects.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
